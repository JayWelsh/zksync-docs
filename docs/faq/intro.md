# Overview

**[zkSync v1 is Live on Mainnet!](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-is-live-bringing-trustless-scalable-payments-to-ethereum-9c634b3e6823)**

You can also try our [testnet on Rinkeby](https://testnet.zksync.io).

## Introduction

**zkSync** is a trustless protocol for scalable low-cost payments on Ethereum, powered by zkRollup technology. It uses zero-knowledge proofs and on-chain data availability to keep user's funds as safe as though they never left the mainnet.

While security is our paramount priority, user and developer experience are central to **zkSync** design. We obsessively seek out improvements that eliminate friction and complexity in order to make **zkSync** the most enjoyable platform on Ethereum, for both end-users and builders. The best way to get an impression about it is to [try out zkSync](https://testnet.zksync.io) yourself — it should only take 2 minutes.

## zkSync features

- ETH and ERC20 token transfers with instant confirmations and 10 min finality on L1.
- Mainnet-level security with zero reliance on 3rd parties.
- Zero-cost account creation.
- Ultra-low transaction fees (~ $0.001 per transfer).
- Payments to existing Ethereum addresses (including smart-contracts).
- Fees conveniently payable in token being transferred.
- Withdrawals to mainnet in under 15 min.
- [Multisig](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/musig-schnorr-sig-scheme/The_MuSig_Schnorr_Signature_Scheme.html) support.
- [Privacy](/faq/privacy.html) (coming soon).
- Permissionless [smart contracts](/faq/sc.html) (coming soon).

## Problems zkSync solves

Gas fees for token transfers on Ethereum [exceed $2M per month](https://ethgasstation.info/). With **zkSync** these costs can be reduced to a small fraction.

UX-first crypto wallets like [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Dharma](https://www.dharma.io/) aim to provide a banking alternative to entire societies. **zkSync** makes their mission accomplishable.

The rise of DeFi opens many more interesting use cases. **zkSync** is here to unlock Paypal-scale for your project.

## zkSync in comparison

**zkSync** stands out remarkably in security and usability among existing L2 scaling solutions. Thanks to the combination of cutting-edge cryptography and on-chain data availability, zkRollup (the core technology of **zkSync**) is **the only** L2 scaling solution that doesn't require any operational activity to keep the funds safe. Users can go offline for a year, then come back and be sure to safely withdraw their assets without any external help — even if zkRollup operators were long gone.
